The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#myElement {
  width: 300px;
}

.container #myElement {
  width: 400px;
}

```

The expected behavior is that `#myElement` within the `.container` should have a width of 400px, due to the more specific selector `.container #myElement`.  However, in some cases, the browser might incorrectly apply the `width: 300px` rule from the `#myElement` selector, ignoring the more specific rule. This is an uncommon bug because the specificity rules are well-defined, but certain browser implementations or CSS preprocessors may lead to these issues.
