# Uncommon CSS Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to CSS selector specificity. In certain situations, a more specific selector might be overridden by a less specific one, resulting in unexpected styling.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a possible solution, although the root cause might lie within the browser's CSS engine or a preprocessor used.
