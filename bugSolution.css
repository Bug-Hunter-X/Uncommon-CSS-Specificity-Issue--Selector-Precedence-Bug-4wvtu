One way to resolve this uncommon specificity issue is to increase the specificity of the intended rule. We can achieve this by adding an extra class or ID to the element.

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

#myElement {
  width: 300px;
}

.container .myElementClass {
  width: 400px;
}

```

By adding the `.myElementClass` class, we create a more specific selector which will take precedence. Alternatively, using the `!important` flag (although generally discouraged) can force the rule's application. However, the ideal approach is to restructure the CSS for clarity and predictable specificity.
